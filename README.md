# CY-Strap<br>
DIY, custom fitted, lightweight, low-profile, HMD strap for multiple hmd.<br>
<br>
This headstrap is designed to have a light-fit and minimized pressurepoints on the user's head for maximum comfort in any orientation. It is not intended for miultiple users as it will be formed to the users head and will not be adjustable. The theory of it's construction relies on the facial interface and padding to provide all pressure neccesary to retain the HMD in position. The hmd angle is intended to be stiff to allow the user to adjust forehead vs cheek pressure. <br>
Note that this project invovles working with a heatgun and hot-plastic. Take all neccesary precausions, the guide included is for reference only and i accept no responsibility if you burn yourself in the process of thermoforming.<br>
<br>
The base design has gone through 6 iterations so far using the valve index and vive pro; The current uploaded version has not yet been tested and is intended for the Bigscreen Beyond only.<br>
<br>
This project is a WIP. Design updates will occur and versions for other HMDs will be updated. Currently only 3dprint files are uploaded. Designfiles will be uploaded soon.<br>
<br>

Assembly Process:<br>
1. Print parts in PETG. - No support required. <br>

<br>
2. Put on a beanie.<br>
3. Snap the 2 side arms to your HMD.<br>
4. Heat the back of the headstrap and form it generally to the back of your head. Avoid heading the 2 clips on the side!<br>
5. Snap the 2 side arms to the back of the strap. With the beanie on, choose the setting that is a little too tight.<br>
6. Heat the full assembly (sans clip area) until just pliable.<br>
7. Put back on the hmd and strap (with your beanie still on). Rub the strap around the back of your head to closely form to your headshape.<br>
8. Once cool, un-clip the sides from the back. Trim off any excess strap length. Apply hotglue on the mating areas and re-assemble.<br>
9. Hot-glue the neoprene/pu foam onto all surfaces interfacing with your head. (If you ordered 1/4", i suggest doubleing up on the back.)<br>
10. Unscrew the 2x TORX screws in the upper center of the Bigscreen Beyond HMD.<br>
11. Mount the topstrap adapter (Tbd if can reuse original screws).<br>
12. Thermoform the topstrap adapter to the beyond. <br>
13. Trim the back-surface of your facial interface if neccesary to clear the topstrap adapter (Tbd). <br>
14. Install your topstrap. <br>
